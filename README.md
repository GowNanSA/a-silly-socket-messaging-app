# a-silly-socket-messaging-app

This program can be used to give yourself therapy, write chat-based fanfiction, make a server and client fall in love, and more! 

I built a small messaging app in C++ that I can verify works using the loop-around method for a class project. There are two files, a server and client. 


First the server needs to be compiled and run. To run this, I used two separate WSL windows. It is also important to make sure that both files are compiled and run separately. 

Next, we run the client. Additionally, when running the client, it is important to type the desired IP address. For this project, I mainly tested it using loop around IP.  


Example Run: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/967ee01f-d3b4-4169-bb6b-cfe4afb33814)

The client can connect and disconnect as many times as needed as long as the server is running.
